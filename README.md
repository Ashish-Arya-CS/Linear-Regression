# Linear-Regression
Linear Regression problem for finding the profit of a restaurant owner who wants to expand his business in various cities.So considering the population in this program we find his profit.
In this ex1.m is the main file which will run OCTAVE or MATLAB and it has many function calls such as ComputeCost which will Compute the cost function for the prices
In the file ex1.m then we have a function to compute value of theta using GradientDescent 
It also has a function to plot the data and ex1.m also shows the contour plot to enable us to know whether our program is running fine or not
I have also uploaded a sample dataset and since it is a linear regression program it works only on a single variable
The submit function was given as while I was learning this algorithm I had to submit this program to my instructor so that is why this function was given.
